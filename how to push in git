Sure, here are the step-by-step instructions for pushing your project to GitHub:

Create a GitHub account: If you don't already have a GitHub account, go to the GitHub website and create one.

Create a new repository: Click on the "+" sign on the top right corner of the GitHub homepage and select "New repository". Give your repository a name and a brief description, and choose whether it should be public or private.

Initialize a Git repository: Open a command prompt or terminal window on your computer and navigate to the directory where your project is stored. Type the command "git init" to initialize a new Git repository.

Add your files: Use the command "git add ." to add all the files in your project to the repository. Alternatively, you can use "git add filename" to add individual files.

Commit your changes: Use the command "git commit -m 'commit message'" to commit your changes to the repository. Be sure to provide a descriptive commit message that explains what changes you made.

Link your local repository to the remote GitHub repository: Use the command "git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repo-name.git" to link your local repository to the remote GitHub repository. Replace "username" with your GitHub username and "repo-name" with the name of your repository.

Push your changes to GitHub: Use the command "git push -u origin master" to push your changes to the GitHub repository. This command will create a new branch called "master" in the remote repository and push your changes to that branch.

And that's it! Your project is now on GitHub. You can view it on the GitHub website, and other users can clone it or make their own contributions.
